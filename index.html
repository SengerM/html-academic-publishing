		<h1 id="introduction section">Introduction</h1>
		<p>One key point in science is to share your results with other people. The most usual way to do this is by producing a PDF document that contains just what a PDF file can contain: Text and images. But what if you want to share a video? What if you want to share something that is interactive? What if you want to read it in your mobile? Or increase the font size? You can't do this with a PDF document (or you'll have a hard time in doing it). Thus, though the PDF format is practically unbeatable in accomplishing its design objective (i.e. to produce a digital version of a “paper document”), it's a pity to limit the capability of documents to what this format allows to do. After all, what is the fraction of PDF files that you actually print? I think we need a change in paradigm here: To abandon some concepts tied to paper-printed documents and start producing material for monitor-rendered documents.</p>
		
		<h2>What can replace the PDF format?</h2>
		<p>PDF is nowadays the most extended format for sharing documents. If you receive a PDF file, it does not matter which device you use or which operating system or which software, you will find a way to read it. If you are in a mobile device you will probably suffer of reading a PDF in such a small screen, but you will definetly be able to read it. So if we are going to replace the PDF format, we need something that is at least as universal as the PDF. We also need something that can handle all the stuff that a PDF file can contain, this however is not complicated as this consists just in images and text.</p>
		<p>So, which is a good alternative to replace PDF? Well, if you think of websites they can show text, images, and they render good with appropriate text size either in a computer or in a mobile. It does not matter which operating system do you use or which web browser, the web site will display fine. This looks promising.</p>
		<p>The progress that has been done in the last decades with HTML is amazing. You can show literally any type of content and display it however you want. So the technologies behind web sites look as a good option to replace the PDF format. Furthermore, these technologies are free, cross platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, etc), device friendly (computer, cell phone, tablet, etc), easy share, etc.</p>
		
		<h3>Still want a PDF?</h3>
		<p>You still want a PDF? Open this document with your favourite web broser, hit <code>ctrl+print</code> and save it as a PDF file. Firefox can do this, probably all other "famous" browsers can too. You may have to set up the zoom, margins, background, etc. such that it looks fine as in the browser. But believe me, it is trivial to get a good looking PDF from this.</p>
		
		<h2>Latex vs HTML</h2>
		<p>In physics, math and other related fields of science it is very common to write documents using Latex. Latex is very nice and powerful, it produces amazing PDF files. But this is preciselly the problem I see: It produces PDFs. If you write in Latex it is because you want a PDF.</p>
		<p>HTML, as Latex, is a markup language but, in contrast, it is much more widespread due to its masive usage in websites. The comunity of HTML users is infinitely bigger than the comunity of Latex users and HTML is beautifully rendered by any modern web browser available in any device.</p>
		<p>So, suppose you want to embed a video in your document, or produce a document which adapts itself to the width of the window in which your are reading it, or that has some interactive feature. You can probably implement this for Latex, but you will have a lot of work<footnote>I guess you will have to invent some new format from scratch.</footnote>. For HTML this is already done! You just have to write your document and open it with a web browser. But the machinery that makes it work is already implemented and spread around the world.</p>
		<p>In view of this it looks very reasonable to choose HTML as the tool for "the next generation of scientific documents" rather than Latex or anything else.</p>
		
		
		<h1>HTML academic publishing</h1>
		<p>Here I will describe my current approach which produces a document as the one you are reading right now.</p>
		
		<h2>The structure of the documents</h2>
		<p>This is based in HTML so anything that applies to HTML also applies to this. The structure of the document must follow that for HTML. As an example you can take the source code for this document, just select "view source" with your favourite web browser or download this file (using <code>ctrl+s</code> for example) and open it with a text editor.</p>
		
		<h2>Sections and sub-sections</h2>
		<p>Scientific documents are structured in sections, sub-sections, sub-sub-sections and so on. To accomplish this in HTML you can use the <code>&lt;h1></code>, <code>&lt;h2></code>,... tags. The scripting engine I have linked to this HTML will automatically number the sections and also produce a table of contents.</p>
		
		<h5>A very indented section at once</h5>
		<p>This is an h5 before h4, h3...</p>
		
		<h3>Unnumbered sections</h3>
		<p>Sometimes you want to put a section header but without numbering it and without listing it in the table of contents. This can be done just by specifying <code>class="unnumbered"</code> for the section you don't want to number, as follows:</p>
		<h4 class="unnumbered">This is an unnumbered section</h4>
		<p>This section will not be listed in the table of contents, it is just aesthetic. You can do this with any type of heading tag.</p>
		
		<h3>Two sections with the same name</h3>
		<h3 id="I want two sections with the same title">Two sections with the same name</h3>
		<p>Two sections with the same name requre at least one of them with a different id. Otherwise they are the same section and we don't know which of them to refer to when there is a cross reference.</p>
		
		<h1>Mathematic equations</h1>
		<p>Somebody has already implemented this for HTML. Fortunately the support for mathematic equations can be added just by linking a script with a few lines in the header of the HTML file. Then you can just write your equations using Latex code, which is very nice for equations. You can add inline equations $x^2+x+1=0$ and you can add "display" equations 
				
				<equation id="my first equation">$$\intop_0^1f(x)dx=\pi\text{.}$$</equation>

			The previous equation is numbered. What happens if I insert an equation with no id?
				
				<equation>$$E=mc^2$$</equation>
			
			The equation is numbered, though I cannot insert a reference to it because it has no id. Now I have another important equation
			
				<equation id="Dirac equation">$$\left( i \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m \right) \psi = 0$$</equation>
			
			that later on I will cite. Now I will try a very long equation:
				
				<equation id="very long equation">$$\frac{dF}{dx}\frac{dx}{dy}\frac{dy}{d\xi}=\intop_{\mathbb{R}}f(\zeta)e^{-\zeta}\cos(w^{2}-\zeta)\ d\zeta+\frac{3x^{3}+(\nabla\times\boldsymbol{E})\cdot\boldsymbol{B}}{\vec{r}\cdot\vec{E}}+8\pi\hbar+\log\cos\tan\sin\pi$$</equation>
		</p>
		<p>Is it possible to define our custom Latex commands? This would be extremly useful. So I have this:
			
			$$f(x) \overset{\text{def}}{=} \frac{\sin x}{x}$$
			
			where the $\overset{\text{def}}{=}$ is hardcoded. Can I define the command <code>\DEF</code> that implements this symbol? So here I define the symbol:
			
			$\def\DEF{\overset{\text{def}}{=}}$ <!-- This is the definition of a symbol for Latex equations -->
			
			and now I will try to use it:
			
			$$f(x)\DEF\frac{\cos x}{x}$$
			
			Yes!! It worked!
		</p>
		
		<h1>Figures</h1>
		<p>One very crucial aspect is to be able to insert figures with captions. Of course this is possible in HTML. The figure below is inserted in such a way that its width matches the width of the document, so if you change the width of the window you are using to read this document the size of the image will also change accordingly.</p>
		<figure class="figure" id="figure with Newton in full width">
			<image src="media/Inkscape.svg" width="100%"></image>
			<figcaption class="figure">This image was created with Inkscape and inserted directly into this HTML file. So you are seeing a vector image, with all the cool things this implies. This image was configured to fit the width of the document, so if you change the width of the window in which you are reading this it should also change the width of this image. This is a cross reference inside a caption: see figure <crossref>measured delay average</crossref>.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>We can also specify the size we want for our image such that it does not change with the width of the window:</p>
		<figure class="figure">
			<image src="media/Inkscape.svg" height=333></image>
			<figcaption class="figure">We can also set the size for the image, if we want. In this example I have specified the height and this automatically fixes the width. If you change the size of the window this image should remain fixed.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<h2>Interactive plots</h2>
		<p>I started saying that one major drawback of PDF files is that you cannot display more than text and images. But up to now I have only showed you text and images here. Let's go one step further and insert an interactive plot produced with <a href="https://plotly.com/">plotly</a>:</p>
		<figure class="figure" id="figure with math in caption">
			<iframe class="plotly" src="media/Reconstruction error mean.html" style="width: 555px ! important;"></iframe>
			<figcaption class="figure">This is the caption, it may contein math $x^2 = 5$. This plot may represent eq. <crossref>very long equation</crossref>. This plot has a "custom width" which is implemented by adding <code>style="width: 555px ! important;"</code> to the <code>iframe</code>.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>Note that in this plot you can zoom in, you can enable/disable the elements by clickin in the legend, etc. This has proven to be very useful to me when showing my results to other scientists.</p>
		<p>Of course we can make this plots to fill the full width of the window so they change as we reshape the window:</p>
		<figure class="figure" id="measured delay average">
			<figcaption class="figure">Note that you can place the caption above the figure, not only below. Just place the <code>figcaption</code> tag where you want the caption to be.</figcaption>
			<iframe class="plotly" src="media/Measured delay average vs set delay.html"></iframe>
		</figure>
		<p>Another advantage of these "interactive plots" is that the text in the legend/labels zooms accordingly to the zoom of the window. Try to <code>ctrl+wheel</code> to change the zoom in this window and see how the text and markers in these plots is modified. Cool.</p>
		
		<h1>Cross referencing</h1>
		<p>This is the very first implementation of cross referencing for figures: See figure <crossref>measured delay average</crossref> or figure&nbsp;<crossref>figure with Newton in full width</crossref>. This figure has math in its caption: fig. <crossref>figure with math in caption</crossref>.</p>
		<p>We can also insert a reference to an equation like this: See eq. <crossref>my first equation</crossref>. Note that you don't have to specify that this is an equation or add the parentheses, it is automatic.</p>
		<p>Now you can see eq.&nbsp;<crossref>Dirac equation</crossref>.</p>
		<p>It is, of course, possible to reference to sections. For example see section <crossref>introduction section</crossref> or <crossref>Mathematic equations</crossref>, or even <crossref>Interactive plots</crossref>. For the two sections with the same name we can refer to them using their <code>id</code>s, or the title of the section for the one with no <code>id</code> defined: See section <crossref>Two sections with the same name</crossref> that has no <code>id</code> defined or <crossref>I want two sections with the same title</crossref> that has <code>id</code> defined.</p>
		<p>This is a cross reference to the very long equation: <crossref>very long equation</crossref>. This has problems when it is close to the left margin, try with this one <crossref>very long equation</crossref>.</p>
		
		<h2>Pop-ups in cross references</h2>
		<p>Hover your mouse pointer over any cross reference (e.g. this one <crossref>Dirac equation</crossref>) to see what happens. This is really nice and useful!</p>
		
		<h1>Footnotes</h1>
		<p>It is usual to add footnotes when something needs clarification but you don't want to overload the text. Here you can add footnotes by using the <code>&lt;footnote></code> tag. For example here you have a footnote<footnote>This is a footnote. We can have an equation $e^{i\pi}+1=0$.</footnote>.</p>
		
		<h1>Still to do</h1>
		<p>Though this is already looking good, there is still much work to do:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Implement foot notes that are displayed on hover with the mouse.</li>
			<li>Implement bibliography and references.</li>
			<li>Implement a translator Latex → this.</li>
			<li>Probably many things more.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h1>How to use this as a template</h1>
		<p>You can download the code from <a href="https://github.com/SengerM/html-academic-publishing">this Github repo</a> and use this document as a template. To edit you open it with your favourite text editor, to render you open it with your favourite web browser.</p>
