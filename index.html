		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>One key point in science is to share your results with other people. The most usual way to do this is by producing a PDF document with either slides or “paper pages” that contains just what a PDF file can contain: Text and images. But what if you want to share a video? What if you want to share something that is interactive? You can't do this with a PDF document. Nowadays filming videos and producing interactive media has become very accessible to everyone. Thus, though the PDF format is practically unbeatable in accomplishing its design objective (i.e. to produce a digital version of a “paper document”), it's a pity to be stuck with the PDF format since the 90s. I think we need a change in paradigm here: To abandon some concepts tied to paper-printed documents and start producing material for monitor-rendered documents. After all, what is the fraction of PDF files that you actually print?</p>
		
		<h2>What can replace the PDF format?</h2>
		<p>PDF is nowadays the most extended format for sharing documents. If you receive a PDF file, it does not matter which device you use or which operating system or which software, you will find a way to read it. So if we are going to replace the PDF format, we need something that is at least as universal as the PDF.</p>
		<p>But how can we do this? Well, if you think of websites the progress that has been done in the last decades is amazing. You can show literally any type of content and display it however you want. So the technologies behind web sites look promising to replace old school PDF files. Furthermore, these technologies are free, cross platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, etc), device friendly (computer, cell phone, tablet, etc), easy to share, and if you still want to have a PDF file you can just <code>ctrl+p</code> the document and produce a nice PDF separated in "paper pages". One example of such a "scientific HTML publication" is this document that you are reading.</p>
		
		<h2>Latex vs HTML</h2>
		<p>In physics, math and other related fields of science it is very common to write documents using Latex. Latex is very nice and powerful, it produces amazing PDF files. Latex is a markup language, as it is HTML. The problem with Latex is that the community of users it has, as compared to HTML, is very small. Furthermore the documentation for Latex is very poor, if existent at all. In contrast, HTML is very well documented and the community of users is infinitely bigger. Also, web browsers cannot render Latex files. So if you write a document in Latex your (almost) only option is to produce a PDF file to share. Thus, although Latex is very popular in our community and it is a very powerful tool, I think it is time to replace it by something bigger as HTML. If you are used to writing in Latex, switching to this type of HTML document is very easy.</p>
		
		<h1>HTML academic publishing</h1>
		<p>Here I will describe my current approach which produces a document as the one you are reading right now.</p>
		
		<h2>The structure of the documents</h2>
		<p>This is based in HTML so anything that applies to HTML also applies to this. The structure of the document must follow that for HTML. As an example you can take the source code for this document, just select "view source" with your favourite web browser or download this file (using <code>ctrl+s</code> for example) and open it with a text editor.</p>
		
		<h2>Sections and sub-sections</h2>
		<p>Scientific documents are structured in sections, sub-sections, sub-sub-sections and so on. To accomplish this in HTML you can use the <code>&lt;h1></code>, <code>&lt;h2></code>,... tags. The scripting engine I have linked to this HTML will automatically number the sections and also produce a table of contents.</p>
		
		<h3>Unnumbered sections</h3>
		<p>Sometimes you want to put a section header but without numbering it and without listing it in the table of contents. This can be done just by specifying <code>class="unnumbered"</code> for the section you don't want to number, as follows:</p>
		<h4 class="unnumbered">This is an unnumbered section</h4>
		<p>This section will not be listed in the table of contents, it is just aesthetic. You can do this with any type of heading tag.</p>
		
		<h1>Mathematic equations</h1>
		<p>Somebody has already implemented this for HTML. Fortunately the support for mathematic equations can be added just by linking a script with a few lines in the header of the HTML file. Then you can just write your equations using Latex code, which is very nice for equations. You can add inline equations $x^2+x+1=0$ and you can add "display" equations 
				
				<equation id="my first equation">$$\intop_0^1f(x)dx=\pi\text{.}$$</equation>

			The previous equation is numbered. What happens if I insert an equation with no id?
				
				<equation>$$E=mc^2$$</equation>
			
			The equation is numbered, though I cannot insert a reference to it because it has no id. Now I have another important equation
			
				<equation id="Dirac equation">$$\left( i \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m \right) \psi = 0$$</equation>
			
			that later on I will cite. Now I will try a very long equation:
				
				<equation>$$\frac{dF}{dx}\frac{dx}{dy}\frac{dy}{d\xi}=\intop_{\mathbb{R}}f(\zeta)e^{-\zeta}\cos(w^{2}-\zeta)\ d\zeta+\frac{3x^{3}+(\nabla\times\boldsymbol{E})\cdot\boldsymbol{B}}{\vec{r}\cdot\vec{E}}+8\pi\hbar+\log\cos\tan\sin\pi$$</equation>
		</p>
		
		<h1>Figures</h1>
		<p>One very crucial aspect is to be able to insert figures with captions. Of course this is possible in HTML. The figure below is inserted in such a way that its width matches the width of the document, so if you change the width of the window you are using to read this document the size of the image will also change accordingly.</p>
		<figure class="figure" id="figure with Newton in full width">
			<image src="media/Inkscape.svg" width="100%"></image>
			<figcaption class="figure">This image was created with Inkscape and inserted directly into this HTML file. So you are seeing a vector image, with all the cool things this implies. This image was configured to fit the width of the document, so if you change the width of the window in which you are reading this it should also change the width of this image.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>We can also specify the size we want for our image such that it does not change with the width of the window:</p>
		<figure class="figure">
			<image src="media/Inkscape.svg" height=333></image>
			<figcaption class="figure">We can also set the size for the image, if we want. In this example I have specified the height and this automatically fixes the width. If you change the size of the window this image should remain fixed.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<h2>Interactive plots</h2>
		<p>I started saying that one major drawback of PDF files is that you cannot display more than text and images. But up to now I have only showed you text and images here. Let's go one step further and insert an interactive plot produced with <a href="https://plotly.com/">plotly</a>:</p>
		<figure class="figure">
			<iframe class="plotly" src="media/Reconstruction error mean.html" style="width: 555px ! important;"></iframe>
			<figcaption class="figure">This is the caption, it may content math $x^2 = 5$. This plot has a "custom width" which is implemented by adding <code>style="width: 555px ! important;"</code> to the <code>iframe</code>.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>Note that in this plot you can zoom in, you can enable/disable the elements by clickin in the legend, etc. This has proven to be very useful to me when showing my results to other scientists.</p>
		<p>Of course we can make this plots to fill the full width of the window so they change as we reshape the window:</p>
		<figure class="figure" id="measured delay average">
			<figcaption class="figure">Note that you can place the caption above the figure, not only below. Just place the <code>figcaption</code> tag where you want the caption to be.</figcaption>
			<iframe class="plotly" src="media/Measured delay average vs set delay.html"></iframe>
		</figure>
		<p>Another advantage of these "interactive plots" is that the text in the legend/labels zooms accordingly to the zoom of the window. Try to <code>ctrl+wheel</code> to change the zoom in this window and see how the text and markers in these plots is modified. Cool.</p>
		
		<h1>Cross referencing</h1>
		<p>This is the very first implementation of cross referencing for figures: See figure <crossref>measured delay average</crossref> or figure <crossref>figure with Newton in full width</crossref>.</p>
		<p>We can also insert a reference to an equation like this: See eq. <crossref>my first equation</crossref>. Note that you don't have to specify that this is an equation or add the parentheses, it is automatic.</p>
		<p>Now you can see eq. <crossref>Dirac equation</crossref>.</p>
		
		<h1>Still to do</h1>
		<p>Though this is already looking good, there is still much work to do:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Implement cross reference for sections, equations, figures, anything.</li>
			<li>Number equations.</li>
			<li>Implement foot notes that are displayed on hover with the mouse.</li>
			<li>Implement bibliography and references.</li>
			<li>Probably many things more.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h1>How to use this as a template</h1>
		<p>You can download the code from <a href="https://github.com/SengerM/html-academic-publishing">this Github repo</a> and use this document as a template. To edit you open it with your favourite text editor, to render you open it with your favourite web browser.</p>
