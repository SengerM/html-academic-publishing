# HTML scientific documents

I want to replace the PDF format, which is tied to the concept of a paper-printed document, with something more modern that is not tied to that. 

You can see how this "PDF replacement attempt" looks like in [this link](https://sengerm.github.io/html-academic-publishing/).

## Tested

As of April 2021 this was tasted in the following browsers and operating systems:

- Firefox in Linux.
- Chrome in Windows.
- Edge in Windows.
- Chrome in Android.
- Firefox in Android.
- Brave in Android.

In all cases no issues were found.

## Reference, documentation and template

You can find documentation [here](https://github.com/SengerM/html-academic-publishing/blob/main/template.html). You can also use that file as a template. Just download it and start playing. Open it with your favourite text editor and at the same time with your favourite web browser. Let the magic begin...
